The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation, such as using incorrect units or syntax, it could cause unexpected layout or rendering issues. For example, if you attempt to subtract a length from a percentage, or if you use a wrong operator, or if you forget a closing parenthesis. This may lead to unexpected outcomes or failure to render parts of the page.
