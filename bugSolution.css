The `calc()` function requires careful attention to detail.  Make sure all operators are correct (+, -, *, /), ensure units are compatible (e.g., don't subtract pixels from percentages), and double-check the parentheses are balanced. 

For example, instead of:

```css
/* Incorrect: Unit mismatch */
width: calc(50% - 10px);
```

Use something like:

```css
/* Correct: All in percentages or pixels */
width: calc(50% - 10%); /* Or width: calc(100px - 10px); */
```

Another common mistake is unbalanced parentheses:

```css
/* Incorrect: Unbalanced Parentheses */
width: calc(100px + (50% - 10px);
```

```css
/* Correct: Balanced parentheses */
width: calc(100px + (50% - 10px));
```
